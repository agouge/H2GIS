This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to H2GIS, the new spatial extension
of the [H2][] database engine.

## What is H2GIS?

In a nutshell: H2GIS is to [H2][] as [PostGIS][] is to [PostgreSQL][].

H2GIS adds support for

* `(MULTI)POINT`, `(MULTI)LINESTRING` and `(MULTI)POLYGON` types
* the functions specified by the [OpenGIS][] [Simple Features Implementation
  Specification for SQL][] and
* additional spatial functions we develop, including our graph analysis package
  [H2Network][]

## Get help

If you get stuck or just have a question, send us a line on our H2GIS [user][]
or [developer][] mailing list. There is also the [H2 Google Group][]. And
developers can check out our [Javadoc page][].

## Check back soon!

This documentation is currently under active development, so check back soon
for updates!

If you have suggestions for topics we have not yet covered, or you have a tip that others could find useful,
please [file an issue][] and we'll potentially include it in this guide.
